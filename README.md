# ML_Regression_Modelling
Supervised Machine Learning: Regression Analysis.

The aim of the following project is to estimate how much revenue an (anonymous) meal kit delivery company can earn per customer 
within the first year of orders through a regression analysis.  

In order to establish that, this document will cover: 
(1) Initial Exploration of Dataset, 
(2) Feature Engineering, 
(3) Model Preparation, 
(4) Model Development and Variable Selection, and 
(5) Model Comparison and Selection.  

Recommendations on how this expected revenue per customer might be increased are based on the highest performing model results and provided at the end. 

Note that for privacy and ownership reasons only the code used will be provided here (not the dataset used).
